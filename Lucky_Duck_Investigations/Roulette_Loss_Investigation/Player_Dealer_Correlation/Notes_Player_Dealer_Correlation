Notes for the player and the dealer analysis reveal that there were approximately 13 counts of losses
The significant losses ranged between ~-$65,000 to  - $182,000 occuring on the days 3/10, 3/12 and 3/15
During the times of the losses, everytime the Roulette game dealer at those times was Billy Jones.
The player Mylie Schmidt was present in every session of the game when there was a loss.
Note that this evidence has been compiled in the Dealer_working_during_losses file and Roulette_Losses
The fact that it was the same dealer (Billy Jones) and the player (Mylie Schmidt) every time a significant loss occurred is not likely a co-incidence and offers evidence in the support of a coordinated activity of theft form the casino
